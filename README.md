# Face and Eye Tracking using OpenCV in C++

This project demonstrates face and eye tracking using OpenCV in C++. It detects and 
tracks faces and eyes in real-time from a video file or a webcam feed and displays 
the distance from the camera to the detected face.

## Prerequisites
* OpenCV 4.x
* C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio)
* CMake (optional, for building the project)

## Setup
* Install OpenCV: Ensure that OpenCV is installed on your system. You can download pre-built binaries or build from source. For instructions, visit the OpenCV website.
* Configure Paths: Update the paths to the Haar cascade files and the video file in the source code.
